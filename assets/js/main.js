/* This is the entry point of the game. */

/* First, some background on Solitaire (Patience, for those who want to follow along on Wikipedia).
   The board has four sections we care about:
   - the stock, which is the pile in which cards that haven't been dealt are put face-down. You can
     take one or three cards from it and place them in the waste pile by clicking on it.
   - the waste, which is the pile cards you take from the stock are put in. You can drag the top-
     most card from the waste anywhere.
   - the 4 foundation piles, where you have to stack cards from A to K on top of each other (K is
     the last). All cards in a stack must have the same suit. The game ends when you have four
     complete stacks here.
   - the 7 tableau piles, where cards are placed at the start of the game. Cards in the tableau
     piles can be face-down or face-up; face-down cards must be located below face-up ones. The
     face-up cards must additionally be of alternating colours and consecutive numbers (higher ones
     above). If a face-down card is the topmost one in a pile, it can be flipped. If a pile is
     empty, a K card of any suit can be dragged into the spot. The nth tableau pile (numbering from
     1) should contain (n-1) face-down cards and one face-up card at the start of the game.
   
   Next, some background on SOL.EXE. All numbers are in pixels, and coords as (X, Y) with  X
   being left to right and Y top to bottom:
   - The window size is 585 x 367. This is currently specified in index.html on the <canvas> tag.
   - Each card is 71 x 93.
   - The horizontal spacing between cards (and the window edge) is 11.
   - The vertical spacing between the top row (stock/waste/foundation) and the tableau is 6.
   - The vertical spacing between face-down cards in the tableau (and the first face-up one) is 3.
   - The vertical spacing between face-up cards in the tableau is 15.
   - Cards in the foundations are stacked on top of one another with no spacing.
   - The stock starts drawing at (11, 6).
   - The waste starts drawing at (93, 6).
   - The foundations start drawing at (257, 6).
   - The tableau starts drawing at (11, 111).
   - TODO: stock stacking, draw-3 mode, etc.
